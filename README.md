### Assembly

Use the shaft portion of the M3x12 chicago bolts for the top part of the lid, and the M3x6 screws for the lid bottom.  Only layers #1 - #5 will be screwed together since layer #7 of the lid has large cutouts for the chicago bolts on the tray side.  Which means that you'll need to attach layer #7 to the bottom of the lid using double-sided tape or glue.

The tray section will only have 3 layers of acrylic which are held together by the M3x8 chicago bolts.  Again, use the shaft side of the bolt on top so that the slotted head is on the bottom.

Now push the silicone T-plugs through all the tray holes from bottom until they snap into place.
